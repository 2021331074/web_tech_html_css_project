    <h2>üëß About Me</h2>

  <p><strong>Hey there! I‚Äôm Richee</strong></p>
  <p>
    I‚Äôm a passionate and curious software developer who thrives at the intersection of logic and creativity. 
    My technical foundation was built through low-level languages like <strong>C</strong> and <strong>C++</strong>, 
    where I learned the fundamentals of memory, performance, and how computers <em>really</em> work. 
    As I progressed, I expanded into <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>, diving into 
    object-oriented programming, automation, and backend systems. Eventually, I discovered the world of 
    <strong>web development</strong>, where I now apply my full-stack skills using 
    <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong>, and modern tools to build clean and responsive web apps.
  </p>

  <h3>‚öôÔ∏è Technical Skills</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript</li>
    <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React (or your preferred framework), REST APIs</li>
    <li><strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong> Git, GitHub, MySQL/PostgreSQL, VS Code, Linux</li>
    <li><strong>Concepts I Love:</strong> Data structures & algorithms, clean code, problem-solving, performance optimization</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üß† My Approach</h3>
  <p>
    I believe that <strong>great software is simple, purposeful, and elegant</strong>. 
    From designing a user interface to writing efficient algorithms, I focus on creating 
    software that is both functional and maintainable. I'm always experimenting, learning, and 
    improving my skills through projects and continuous exploration.
  </p>

  <h3>üöÄ Why I Code</h3>
  <p>
    For me, coding is not just a skill ‚Äî it‚Äôs a craft. I enjoy solving real-world problems 
    and transforming ideas into working software. Whether it‚Äôs a fun project like a Tic Tac Toe game, 
    or a practical system like a Question Management tool, I treat every challenge as a learning opportunity.
  </p>

  <h3>ü§ù Let‚Äôs Connect</h3>
  <p>
    I‚Äôm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and learning from others. 
    Feel free to explore my projects or reach out if you'd like to connect!
